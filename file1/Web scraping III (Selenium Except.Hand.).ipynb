If your booking includes minors, you have to email prior processing a reservation in order to confirm ages and provide written parental consent (if applicable), otherwise you will be refused the accommodation with no refunds (a partial voucher could be provided for a future stay). Any issue has to be addressed directly at Reception by the adult guests acting as guardians for the underline reservation. We do not offer child care services and we are not responsible for any minor staying at our property. We cater primarily to adult guests and expect everyone to behave responsibly and respectfully at all times. Third party complains will be automatically dismissed. \\n\\nPREPAYMENT:\\n*All reservations must be PREPAID the day of booking and are NON REFUNDABLE. \\n*Unpaid reservations WILL BE SUBJECT TO AVAILABILITY AND MIGHT INCUR A 20%-40% SURCHARGE if they\\'re not fully paid upon reserving. \\nAll of our reservations are NON-REFUNDABLE regardless of circumstances.

This is a separate business and we don’t have any affiliation with them. \\n\\nWHAT TO EXPECT:\\n*Our Standards are in line with the accommodation type we offer (BUDGET HOSTEL). The NX London is not a Hotel, the shared nature of our dormitory rooms might occasionally result into clutter. Bathrooms are located in the hallways and partaken with other guests, some wait-time might be required on peak times. \\n*In order to maintain our prices low, we kept \"on location amenities\" to a minimum: There are no toiletries, air conditioning and/or a mini-bar in the rooms. We feature a mix of long term and leisure guests, this gives the ambience a uniquely quirky character, as a consequence it would be impossible to meet everybody\\'s taste. Discriminatory comments or behavior won\\'t be tolerated.\\n*Our 10 bed dorm can host up to 10 guests! If you\\'re not comfortable sharing the space with that many people (and their belongings) please consider booking a different dorm or request an upgrade with price difference (subject to availability). \\n* The hostel is primarily designed for adults and we expect our guests to act in a responsible and respectful manner at all times. \\n* Upon reserving, you agree and acknowledge that our staff is trained to enforce our policies and procedures in a firm and assertive manner, holding everybody to a high standard of behavior and with zero-tolerance policy for any breaches. If they instruct you to follow a particular rule or procedure, we kindly request that you comply with their directions. We ask that guests understand that repeated breaches of policy can put a strain on our staff. \\n* Being uncomfortable with a high level of enforcement or the manner in which our staff members communicate shall not constitute grounds for a complaint.\\n\\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION:\\n*Reception ONLY opens 4:00pm to 1:00am. \\n*Property is not wheelchair accessible*\\n*We do not accept customers over 65 years old unless they are part of a group staying in a private room.

For women travelers with a small budget Hostelle is ideal, we are very well communicated with the airport and the city center. \\n\\nLondon has a lot of different attractions and interesting places to visit. Because there are so many options, we from Hostelle have made a list of the absolute must-visits in London.\\n\\nHyde Park:\\nHyde Park is presumably the foremost notable park in London, it’s among the biggest. The park has historical significance, having hosted a variety of demonstrations and protests together with protests by suffragettes. The park hosts many performances weekly in addition to activities like paddle-boating, seeing several swans, and taking in a breath of fresh air in the center of the city. A must-visit.\\n\\nWestminster:\\nWestminster is home to the Houses of Parliament and the world-famous Big Ben.

Whilst visiting these landmarks, be sure to rest your feet in Parliament Square which features statues of important political individuals including Nelson Mandela and Winston Churchill.\\n\\nCamden:\\nCamden is a well-known cultural neighborhood in north London. Known for its alternative culture, the crowds here are filled with goths, punks, rockabillies, and tourists alike. Camden has a vibrant body mod community, and you will find several piercing and tattoo shops in this part of town.\\n\\nLondon Eye:\\nA trip to London isn’t complete without a visit to the iconic London Eye. Originally constructed to celebrate the millennium, the Eye is a giant Ferris wheel offering gorgeous views across the city.
